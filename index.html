            <h2>Juicy keep your body hydrate </h2>
            <p>Juice is a delicious and refreshing beverage whether you prefer it fresh-squeezed or straight out of the carton. 
                But is a daily cup of juice good for you? 
                Fruit juices are often considered less healthy than their whole-food counterparts due to higher sugar concentration, more calories and less fiber—which 
                can reduce the satiety of these beverages and, over time, could contribute to weight gain and obesity.</p>

            <p>Leafy green vegetables are nutrient rich because leaves contain the light-catching, 
                energy-converting machinery of plants. 
                Salad greens contain Vitamin A, Vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, folate, fiber, and phytonutrients</p>

            <h2>Acai Bowl - fresh for you</h2>
            <p>Acai berries are high in antioxidants and have been associated with several health benefits in human and animal studies.
                Acai bowls — especially those that are commercially prepared — 
                are high in calories and sugar, which could contribute to weight gain 
                and health issues like liver problems, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.
